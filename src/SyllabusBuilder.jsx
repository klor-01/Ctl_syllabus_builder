const SLO_PRIMER = `A student learning outcome describes what a student will be able to DO by the end of this course. It is not a list of what you will cover. That difference is the whole thing. "We will cover the causes of the Cold War" is a topic. "Students will evaluate competing explanations for the outbreak of the Cold War using primary sources" is an outcome, because you can point to a specific assignment that shows whether a student did it or not.

Three tests for a workable outcome:

1. Can you see it? Use verbs a person can observe: analyze, construct, evaluate, compare, design, defend, calculate, diagnose. Avoid understand, appreciate, know, and be familiar with. Nothing a student does can prove or disprove those.

2. Can you grade it? Every outcome should connect to at least one assignment, exam, project, or performance in this course. If nothing in your grade breakdown produces evidence for an outcome, then either the outcome or the assessment plan needs to change. This builder checks that for you.

3. Would a student recognize it? Outcomes are written for students, not for reviewers. A student reading the list should come away knowing what they are being asked to get good at.

Three to six outcomes is the usual range. Past that they stop working as a guide and start reading as a wall.

WHY THE GENERAL EDUCATION OUTCOMES ARE ALSO LISTED

If this course carries General Education credit, it is doing two jobs at once. It teaches your discipline, and it also delivers outcomes that belong to UTM's General Education curriculum as a whole. Those Gen Ed outcomes are what the university reports to SACSCOC and THEC as evidence that the curriculum actually works, and that evidence comes from courses like this one. Listing them next to your own outcomes does two useful things. It tells a student why this course satisfies a requirement they did not personally choose, and it tells the next person reviewing the program exactly where that requirement gets met.

You still write your own course outcomes. The Gen Ed set sits alongside them, not instead of them.

Delete this box once your outcomes are written. It is here to explain, not to print.`;

Respect academic integrity. All work must adhere to the academic integrity policies of this course and the university. Unpermitted use of AI is a form of academic misconduct under the UTM Student Code of Conduct.

Cite AI use. If AI-generated material informs your work, cite it as "Generated using [AI tool]" and include the prompt you used. Copying output without attribution is plagiarism.
